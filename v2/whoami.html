				<h2 class="title">Who am I?</h2>

				<p>
					I am a creator. And my one goal in life, is to help a billion people. How will I do that you may ask? Through technology software that will be used in day to day use. It's that simple.
          I am always learning more and more about programming or tech in the real world and how it can help change people's lives for the better. I've made my own software when I started in
          freshman year of Highschool in Visual Basic. It was terrible and useless because the programs only would popup messages that were pointless. But that was only the beginning of a journey
          of hair pulling stress from code that works half the time to making it work 90% of the time. Now I am an experienced web developer and software developer for day to day use and grow my
          skills as each day goes by.
